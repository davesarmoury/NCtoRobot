# NC to Robot

This is a set of scripts that will take points from a CAM system (or elsewhere) and create robot-specific script code to be run natively in a robot controller

## Known issues

Lots.  This repo is very under-developed.  I have plans to make it far more flexible and add documentation (so it isn't nonesense to everyone but me), but that will take time.  Expect changes
